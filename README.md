# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A simple visualizer for various sorting algorithms using the Raylib framework.
Note: this is intended to be an entertaining and educational visualization of how sorting algorithms operate and is not an accurate benchmark of their efficiency. Different algorithms run at different framerates and different algorithms may do a drastically different amount of work between frames. Framerates for each algorithm were chosen such that each algorithm both runs at a comprehensible speed and completes the sort in a reasonable length of time.
